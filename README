shortid
=======

This project is a Go port of 

    https://github.com/mozillazg/ShortURL/blob/master/shorturl/libs/short_url.py 

for generating Tiny URL- and bit.ly-like URLs.

A bit-shuffling approach is used to avoid generating consecutive, predictable URLs. However, 
the algorithm is deterministic and will guarantee that no collisions will occur.

Sample Usage:

    import shortid

    func main() {
        shortid.String(12)  // JyNvD
        shortid.Int("JyNvD") // 12
    }
